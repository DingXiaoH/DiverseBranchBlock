# Diverse Branch Block: Building a Convolution as an Inception-like Unit (PyTorch) (CVPR-2021)

This is the PyTorch implementation. The MegEngine version is at https://github.com/megvii-model/DiverseBranchBlock

Just finished my ICCV submission. Will work on the camera ready and code tomorrow!

Sometimes I call it ACNet v2 because 'DBB' is two bits larger than 'ACB' in ASCII. (lol)

Will release it in several days.
