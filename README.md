# Diverse Branch Block: Building a Convolution as an Inception-like Unit (PyTorch) (CVPR-2021)

This is the PyTorch implementation. The MegEngine version is at https://github.com/megvii-model/DiverseBranchBlock

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13425

Will update this whole repo very soon.

Update: released DiverseBranchBlock. Refactoring the code of transformations. Will release in several hours.

Sometimes I call it ACNet v2 because 'DBB' is two bits larger than 'ACB' in ASCII. (lol)
